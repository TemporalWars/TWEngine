<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Assets Tool</font></h6>
<p>Rest assured, your engine already comes with more than 500 assets, ready to be dropped into your game engine for use! The Assets tool is your one place to quickly locate assets, like trees, bushes, buildings, rocks, and more. Furthermore, the ability to
 Flood your map with a particular asset is amazingly quick and easy, due to the use of the Perlin-Noise generator.
</p>
<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Behaviors Tool</font></h6>
<p>A.I. Steering Behaviors are also included in the Temporal Wars 3D engine. Using the Behaviors tool, &quot;Steering&quot; behaviors can be directly assigned to any playable item within the game world. Behaviors, like the 'Wander' behavior, can easily be assigned to
 an item by simply picking the item in the game world, and then assigning the behavior. Immediately, the item will inherit the A.I. logic from the given behavior.
</p>
<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Height Tool</font></h6>
<p>Directly manipulate the wireframe used in the terrain, with tools like Rise, Lower, Smooth, or flatten. Or instantly create an entire height Map for your terrain, with the included Perlin-Noise generator. Since the editor is integrated with the runtime,
 you can toggle between your game and editors in real-time. </p>

<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Texture Tool</font></h6>
<p>Paint textures onto the terrain, either manually with the paint brush, or procedurally. With the Perlin-Noise generator, you can instantly combine two textures to smoothly create transitions, which would normally take an artist hours to complete manually!
 The ability to also change the ambience color factor or specular light, for each of the dual layers, will create realistic effects normally only seen in AAA engines.
</p>
<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Trigger Area Tool</font></h6>
<p>Trigger Areas are also an important aspect to scripting a game level. The Trigger Area's tool allows the game creator to define areas within the game world, and then assign some user-defined name. Triggers, as the name implies, are triggered when some game
 item, like a tank, or the camera itself, enters a trigger-area. </p>

<h6><font color="#0000ff" size="5">Waypoint Tool</font></h6>
<p>Waypoints are an important aspect to scripting a game level. Within the Temporal Wars 3D engine, waypoints can be set anywhere on the terrain, and then connected to create waypoint-paths. Waypoints provide the ability to script orders in your game, as well
 as create camera cinematic by connecting the camera to a waypoint-path. </p>
